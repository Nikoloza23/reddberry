						We were soo much fun before the pandemic started! Parties almost every weekend and lavish
						employee birthday celebrations! Unfortunately, covid ruined that fun like it did almost
						everything else in the world. But we try our best to zhuzh it up a bit. For example, we host
						biweekly Devtalks where our senior and lead developers talk about topics they are passionate
						about. Previous topics have included Web3, NFT, Laravel 9, Kubernetes, etc. We hold these talks
						in the office but you can join our Zoom broadcast as well. Feel free to join either as an
						attendee or a speaker!
